# Testing across Multiple AngularJS Versions

To make it easier to use the PubNub AngularJS SDK across
versions, we're providing examples using all versions
of the library starting from the latest and greatest 1.3.x,
going back to version 1.0.x.

This is the current list of versions we're testing with:

* 1.3.x (latest): AngularJS version 1.3.0-beta.13, released 2014/06/13
* 1.2.x (legacy): AngularJS version 1.2.18, released 2014/06/13
* 1.1.x : AngularJS version 1.1.5, released 2014/01/15
* 1.0.x : AngularJS version 1.0.8, released 2014/01/15

The comprehensive list of AngularJS versions appears here:

Let us know if there's any way we can help make it easier
to get started with AngularJS and PubNub!
